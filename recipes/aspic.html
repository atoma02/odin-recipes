        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Aspic is a slavic dish of jellied meat stock. The gelatin often includes pieces</p>
        <p>of vegetables and meat. The shape is given by placing the gelatin in a mold.</p>
        <p>Aspic can be used to protect meats, as incasing them in gelatin prevents the</p>
        <p>introduction of bacteria. The meat typically used of aspic includes pig feet,</p>
        <p>rind, ears, and snout.</p>
